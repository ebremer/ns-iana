# # The 'x-relative:?' hack:
# The RDF model only supports absolute IRIs, and so do syntaxes like N-Triples or N-Quads.
# However, in this case, we want the produced Turtle to use specific relative IRI references.
#
# These "pseudo-relative" IRIs are represented in the dummy `x-relative:` scheme,
# which is stripped away from the Turtle serialization.
#
# (In fact, it is stripped upstream of 'sop', because 'sop' supports "relative RDF")
